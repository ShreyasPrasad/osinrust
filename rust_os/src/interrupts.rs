/* There's a lot of different types of CPU exceptions, such as those caused by accessing a write-only
page, or dividing by 0, or accessing a privileged instruction in user mode. 

When an exception occurs, the CPU invokes the corresponding handler function. If an error invokes there
too, a double fault exception is raised and the double fault handler is invoked. If that also errors,
the operating system reboots. 

To handle exceptions, we setup the interrupt descriptor table (IDT). The hardware uses this table directly.
Each row has the same 16-byte format, consisting of the pointer to the handler function and some extra options. 

Each exception has a predefined IDT index. Thus the hardware can automatically load the the IDT entry for each
exception. When an exception occurs*/

The page is not mapped to any physical frame, so accessing it causes a page fault instead of silently corrupting other memory.

a double fault since the page fault exception handler is called with an interrupt stack frame that still points to the guard
page. This causes a triple fault and a system reboot.*/
