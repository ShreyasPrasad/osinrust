/* In order to exit QEMU after tests are run automatically, we can use extra arguments (see
Cargo.toml). The bootimage runner appends the test-args to the default QEMU command for all test 
executables. For a normal cargo run, the arguments are ignored. */

/* There are 2 different approaches for communicating between CPU and peripheral hardware on x86:

    1. Memory-Mapped IO. This is what we did when we accessed the VGA buffer through a memory address explicitly.

    2. Port-Mapped IO. Uses a separate I/O bus for communication. Each connected peripheral has 1 or more port
    numbers. To communicate with such a port, there are special CPU instructions called in an out which take a 
    port number and a date byte.

The isa-debug-exit device uses port-mapped I/O. The iobase parameter specifies on which port address the device 
should live (0xf4 is a generally unused port on the x86â€™s IO bus) and the iosize specifies the port size (0x04 
means four bytes).

When a value is written to the port specified by iobase, it causes QEMU to exit with status equal to (value << 1) | 1.
We create the QemuExitCode u32 struct as the value to write (it is 4 bytes, just like what we specified as the iosize).
